## Abstract

The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix introduces a dynamic long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9× memory compression and a 5.3× speedup in inference throughput.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) (Vaswani et al. 2017), such as GPT (Radford et al. 2019), Llama (Touvron et al. 2023a), and their derivatives, have significantly advanced the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). These models exhibit outstanding performance (Hadi et al. 2023; Chang et al. 2024) across a diverse array of tasks, including text generation, question answering, and machine translation. The Key-Value (KV) Cache plays an essential role in the autoregressive decoding process of LLMs. The KV Cache substantially reduces redundant computations in the attention mechanism by storing KV states from preceding time steps

for subsequent token generation (Xiao et al. 2023). Nevertheless, as sequence lengths grow, the memory footprint of the KV Cache increases linearly, presenting a formidable challenge to hardware resources. For instance, a 70B-parameters model may require over 50GB of memory to maintain the KV Cache for a 20k-token sequence, exceeding typical GPU capacity. In scenarios involving multiple concurrent requests, the KV Cache for each request cannot be shared due to its dependence on unique preceding prompts. Although model parameters can be reused, memory quickly becomes saturated due to the KV Cache demands. Once memory is depleted, data is offloaded to system memory or even disks, resulting in frequent High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) exchanges with system memory. This process causes latency to surge exponentially, leading to catastrophic performance degradation.

The KV Cache’s characteristics outlined above severely restrict LLM deployment and inference efficiency in resourceconstrained environments, underscoring the pressing need for efficient memory optimization (Liu et al. 2024b). Recent research tackling this issue has predominantly focused on reducing the memory overhead of the KV Cache through quantization and sparsification techniques (Shi et al. 2024; Adnan et al. 2024). Quantization methods, in particular, have gained widespread adoption in industry, significantly contributing to the scalability and accessibility of large-scale models (Kumar 2024). Quantizing the KV Cache can markedly reduce memory usage. Existing quantization methods have demonstrated impressive model performance even at very low bit-widths. However, these methods either rely on static one-size-fits-all precision allocation schemes (Liu et al. 2024c,a), lacking flexibility and performance-aware adaptation capabilities, or incur high computational costs of dynamic quantization while failing to adaptively prioritize critical KVs in long-context tasks (Dong et al. 2024; Duanmu et al. 2024). Therefore, they are forced to make suboptimal trade-offs among memory usage, model accuracy, and computational throughput.

To address these problems, this paper proposes KVmix, a novel mixed-precision quantization method for KV Cache. Compared to existing mixed quantization methods (Dong et al. 2024; Li et al. 2025), KVmix analyzes the importance differences of different model layers at a very low cost, thereby allowing for flexible modification of the quantization configuration based on the model’s performance requirements. This flexibility enables KVmix to maximize the

compression rate of the KV Cache and the throughput of the model while maintaining controllable precision. Our specific contributions are as follows:

• We propose a novel layer importance-aware mixedprecision quantization method. This method assesses the importance of KVs at each layer by computing the L2 gradient norms of Key and Value projection weights with respect to the model’s loss function. Based thereon, it independently applies mixed-precision quantization to different layers, allocating higher bit-widths to critical layers and lower to less influential ones. Therefore, it provides the flexibility to balance between accuracy and resource efficiency across diverse inference scenarios. • We propose a dynamic pivotal context selection strategy to optimize long-context tasks. According to the KV importance analysis, it adaptively keeps full-precision KV pairs for recent pivotal tokens while aggressively compressing older pairs. This strategy ensures high-quality sequence generation in long-context inference scenarios while dynamically reducing the number of full-precision KV pairs for better memory optimization. • We design efficient CUDA implementations and a highcompression 3-bit quantization method for KVmix. Extensive experimental results show that KVmix achieves nearly lossless model accuracy across multiple LLMs and datasets, with a 4.9× memory usage reduction and a 5.3× speedup in inference efficiency, outperforming prior stateof-the-art (SOTA) quantization methods for KV Cache.

## Related Work

and Motivation Related Work

To mitigate KV Cache memory challenges, researchers have developed many optimization methods, primarily centered on compression techniques and dynamic memory management (Kwon et al. 2023; Lee et al. 2024). We mainly discuss the KV Cache compression techniques related to this work. Existing compression approaches encompass quantization, sparsification (Zhang et al. 2023; Li et al. 2024), and KV Cache sharing (Sun et al. 2024; Wu and Tu 2024). Our method is orthogonal to existing weight quantization (Frantar et al. 2022; Lin et al. 2024) and sparsification methods, and it can also be used as a guideline for the importance of different layers during KV sparsification to achieve more accurate KV eviction.

Extensive research has focused on reducing the memory overhead of KV Cache through quantization. For example, KIVI (Liu et al. 2024c) introduced a 2-bit asymmetric quantization technique, employing per-channel quantization for Keys and per-token quantization for Values. KVQuant (Hooper et al. 2024) proposed a non-uniform quantization strategy, integrating pre-RoPE per-channel Key quantization with per-token Value quantization. It employs offline calibration to manage outliers, achieving robust performance in long-context inference scenarios. QAQ (Dong et al. 2024) developed a dynamic mixed-precision quantization method that calculates quantization bits for Keys and Values online and optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and compression ratio by predicting attention scores. Atom (Zhao et al.

2024) investigated a mixed-precision scheme involving 4-bit and 8-bit activations, dynamically quantizing activations to adapt to input distributions. QJL (Zandieh, Daliri, and Han 2025) introduced a 1-bit quantization technique for the Key, leveraging the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform followed by sign-bit quantization. KVTuner (Li et al. 2025) frames the mixed quantization of KV caches as a search optimization problem, aiming to find the optimal KV quantization configuration within a vast search space. Numerous other studies have also made significant contributions to KV Cache quantization (Yue et al. 2024; Yang et al. 2024b; Liu et al. 2024a). These efforts generally aim to quantize as many KVs as possible to the lowest feasible bit-width. While methods such as KVQuant, QAQ, and KVTuner have introduced mixedprecision quantization for KV, they often entail significant computational or search overhead. In contrast, this work introduces a lightweight and flexible framework that allows users to dynamically balance quantization bit-width and model accuracy based on specific deployment requirements.

Moreover, several works have identified the attention sink phenomenon, where attention scores excessively favor initial or recent tokens, and newly generated tokens emphasize recent contexts. StreamingLLM (Xiao et al. 2023) leverages this characteristic to achieve efficient infinite-length streaming inference by retaining attention sinks (e.g., initial tokens) alongside recent tokens. PyramidInfer (Yang et al. 2024a) applies layer-wise KV cache compression, selectively keeping key contexts based on attention patterns. Inspired by these works, we propose a dynamic pivotal context selection strategy. Unlike prior approaches, ours determines pivotal context size based on layer-specific KV importance analysis and dynamically updates full-precision KV pairs during decoding, better balancing memory efficiency and generation quality.

Motivation Current KV Cache quantization methods rely on fixed quantization strategies, neglecting the varying contributions of KV across layers to the final output. To substantiate that quantizing Keys or Values from different layers impacts the model differently, we selectively applied 2-bit quantization to the Keys or Values of distinct layers and evaluated the effects on the model’s accuracy, with results presented in Fig. 1. The findings demonstrate that quantizing Keys or Values from different layers has varying impacts on the model’s generation quality. However, efficiently analyzing the contribution disparities across layers of the model to allocate different quantization bits to Keys or Values remains a critical challenge that needs to be addressed.

In each layer of the KV Cache, the computation process works as follows: at time step t, the i-th layer receives hidden states Hi−1,t from the preceding layer’s output. These hidden states are used to compute the current token’s K and V as: Ki,t = Wki · Hi−1,t and Vi,t = Wvi · Hi−1,t, where Wki and Wvi are the projection weights for K and V at the i-th layer. After computation, the computed Ki,t and Vi,t are concatenated with the previously stored KV, yielding the complete K and V sequences up to time step t: Ki,1:t = [Ki,1, Ki,2,..., Ki,t] and Vi,1:t = [Vi,1, Vi,2,..., Vi,t]. This computation process indicates that the Wki and Wvi deter-

mine how Key and Value are extracted from the hidden states, directly affecting the quality of the KV pairs generated by the attention mechanism and the layer’s contribution to the model’s output. Fig. 2 provides heatmaps of the Wk and Wv for the Llama 2-7B model. The heatmaps highlight two key insights: ①Significant variations in KV weight values across different layers. ②Distinct distribution patterns of KV weights within the same layer. For KVs, their values dynamically adapt to changes in the input; however, Wk and Wv are learned during the model’s training phase and remain static during inference. As a result, these weights can be leveraged to assess the importance differences of Keys and Values across layers.

## Methodology

KV Importance Analysis In the attention mechanism, KV is computed by applying the KV projection weight matrices to the hidden state of the previous layer for linear transformation, then combining the result with the Query vector to calculate the attention output. Therefore, the magnitude of the KV projection weights alone is insufficient to measure the importance of KV across layers, necessitating a more precise evaluation metric. This metric should quantify the sensitivity of K and V at each layer to the model’s loss function L. Based on the Motivation and by using the chain rule, we can obtain:

Ki,t = Wki · Hi−1,t (1)

Here, ∇Wki L and ∇Wvi L denote the gradients of L with respect to Wki and Wvi, respectively. ∂L ∂Ki and ∂L

∂Vi represent the partial derivatives of L with respect to the Key and Value, respectively. To quantify the perturbation, assume that the quantization operation introduces small perturbations to the Key and Value matrices, i.e., Kq i = Ki + ∆K and V q i = Vi + ∆V, where ∆K and ∆V are the quantization errors. The change in L due to quantization is ∆L = L(Kq, V q) − L(K, V), which is the difference between the original loss and the quantized loss. To approximate ∆L, perform a firstorder Taylor expansion around Key:

L(Kq, V q) ≈L(K, V) + ∂L

∂K · ∆K + ∂L

∂V · ∆V (7)

Thus, the loss change due to quantization is:

∆L ≈∂L

Based on the above analysis, we propose the KVmix profiler, a gradient-based method that quantifies the contribution of each layer’s Key and Value to the model’s output,

enabling a judicious mixed-precision quantization strategy. Specifically, we compute the L2 norm of the gradients of the model’s loss function L with respect to the Key and Value projection weight matrices for each model layer (∥∇Wki L∥2 and ∥∇Wvi L∥2), and evaluate the importance of the Key and Value components based on these L2 norm values. KVmix profiler captures the dynamic sensitivity of these parameters during the model inference process, and provides a layer-specific importance metric to support efficient mixedprecision quantization in subsequent inference stages.

The implementation of KVmix profiler consists of the following three key steps: ①Data preparation and forward propagation. A full-precision model is loaded, and multiple prompts are randomly sampled from a target dataset to serve as input data. These prompts are tokenized into input tensors using the tokenizer. Leveraging the autoregressive property of LLMs, each input tensor is shifted left by one position to be used as the corresponding label tensor for computing the model’s loss function. Subsequently, the loss value for each input is determined through forward propagation. ②Gradient calculation and importance assessment. For the i-layer of the model, the gradients of the losses with respect to the projection weights of the Key (Wki) and Value (Wvi) are computed independently. This process begins with backpropagation to calculate the gradients, i.e., ∇Wki L and ∇Wvi L. The magnitude of these gradients is then evaluated using the L2 norm, i.e., ∥∇Wki L∥2 and ∥∇Wvi L∥2. The importance scores of the Keys and Values for each layer can be expressed as:

ski = ∥∇Wki L∥2, svi = ∥∇Wvi L∥2 (10)

A larger ski or svi signifies a greater impact of that i-th layer’s Key or Value on model’s output. To enhance assessment reliability, the gradient norms can be averaged across multiple prompts (p), yielding an average importance score for each layer’s Key and Value (P is the number of prompts):

¯ski = 1

P

P X p=1 s(p)

ki, ¯svi = 1

P

P X p=1 s(p)

vi (11)

We classify the importance of the Key and Value components across all model layers using the importance scores. The top 20% of the layers of ¯ski and ¯svi are quantized with highbit representations (e.g., 3-bit or 4-bit), while the remaining 80% of layers adopt more aggressive low-bit quantization (e.g., 2-bit). This 20%-80% split is not fixed and can be dynamically adjusted according to the requirements to balance the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Increasing the proportion of low-bit quantization layers can further reduce the memory usage of the KV Cache, but may sacrifice some accuracy. ③Model Configuration and Inference. The KV quantization configuration results derived from the above steps are incorporated into the model configuration, enabling the quantized model to be used for inference. The detailed workflow is depicted in Fig. 3. The profiling is performed offline and therefore does not affect inference efficiency. Moreover, the profiling is performed once, allowing the model to reuse the results for subsequent inference tasks.

Asymmetric Low-Bit Quantization Asymmetric Quantization Strategy We use per-channel and per-token grouping quantization methods for Key and Value, respectively. The KV Cache has the shape [B, nh, T, D], where B is the batch size, nh is the number of attention heads, T is the token sequence length, and D is the head dimension. When the Key is quantized per channel (D), the tensor is reshaped to [B × nh × D, T], with each group comprising all tokens of a single channel. This approach is inspired by the distributional properties of the Key Cache that exhibit significant outliers in the channel dimension, i.e., certain channels exhibit significantly large magnitude values. Per-channel quantization isolates errors within each channel and prevents outliers from affecting other channels. When Value is quantized per token, the shape of the tensor is preserved, and each group contains all channels of a single token. Unlike the Key Cache, the Value Cache has no pronounced outliers, but plays a critical role in computing the attention output. Per-token quantization confines errors to individual tokens, preserving the integrity of other important tokens. This asymmetric quantization strategy effectively reduces errors introduced during KV Cache quantization.

Group-Wise Low-Bit Quantization We use group-wise low-bit quantization to minimize KV Cache memory usage. The process includes: ①Calculation of scaling factor s. For each group (per-channel for Key, per-token for Value), compute s = max_val−min_val qmax using group min/max values, where qmax denotes the maximum quantized value. ②Element quantization. Quantize elements with q = round x−min_val s

, where x represents the original element value, and q is the quantized value. ③Clipping. Limit q to max(0, min(q, qmax)). ④Storage and dequantization. The quantized values are stored using bit operations within a 32-bit integer (int32). For 4, 2, and 1 bit, the number of elements per int32 is: feat_per_int = 32/bit. Dequantization is performed by x = q·s+min_val. For 3-bit quantization, we introduce a new packing strategy to maximize memory efficiency. We organize the quantized elements into blocks of 11, each stored in a 32-bit integer, with the first 10 elements quantized to 3 bits and the 11th element to 2 bits. The clipping range is adjusted based on the element index:

qmax =

7, i = 0, 1,..., 9 3, i = 10 (12)

where i is the element index within a block. This strategy increases packing density by 10% over uniform 3-bit quantization that can only hold 10 elements per int32.

Dynamic Pivotal Context Selection In the KV Cache, not all Keys and Values are equally important for generating future tokens. Recent tokens provide the most relevant contextual information for the generation of subsequent tokens and typically have more impact on the tokens to be generated. We define the KVs corresponding to these pivotal recent tokens as the Recent Pivotal Context (RPC). To optimize model performance while minimizing memory usage, we propose a dynamic RPC selection strategy

based on the importance analysis provided by KVmix profiler. Specifically, for the i-layer, we assign it an RPC selection ratio r based on the ¯ski and ¯svi scores, with higher ¯ski and ¯svi resulting in larger r. The number of RPCs is computed by num_RPC = ⌊r × current_RPC⌋. current_RPC is the sum of the number of new KV states at the current time step and the number of historical RPCs. The corresponding number of KV pairs is selected as RPCs based on num_RPC. We keep full precision for RPCs while performing mixed quantization for less critical and older KV pairs, illustrated in Fig. 4. This strategy ensures that the number of full-precision RPCs is dynamically reduced in runtime during long context inference, thus avoiding excessive memory pressure caused by preserving a large number of full-precision KV pairs, while maintaining high-quality sequence generation. Additionally, since the importance of Key and Value may differ within the same layer, the RPC selection ratio for Key and Value varies accordingly within that layer. The RPC selection ratio can be adjusted to balance accuracy and memory: increasing it improves accuracy but requires more memory.

CUDA Implementation During model inference, the quantization of the KV Cache introduces additional overhead due to quantization and dequantization operations. To improve inference efficiency, we design efficient CUDA kernels for quantization, dequantization, and matrix-vector multiplication. ①Fusion of quantization

and concatenation. In the decoding phase, the KV states of current layer are concatenated with the historical KV Cache. Quantizing the current states before concatenation causes extra memory access overhead. We fuse quantization and concatenation into a single CUDA kernel, processing each element in a streaming manner. KV elements are quantized and appended directly to the historical KV Cache, thereby reducing memory access. CUDA thread blocks process tokens in parallel, and shared memory caches intermediate results to enhance data locality. ②Fusion of dequantization and matrix-vector multiplication. In attention computation, the quantized KV requires dequantization before matrix-vector multiplication. Dequantizing the full KV beforehand increases memory usage. We fuse dequantization with multiplication, dequantizing each element on-the-fly and immediately multiplying and accumulating it with its corresponding element, minimizing memory overhead. ③ Efficient kernels for multi-bit quantization configurations. To support KVmix’s various quantization bit-widths, we develop CUDA kernels for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-bit quantization, along with tailored matrix-vector multiplication kernels for each configuration, ensuring compatibility across bit-widths.

Experimental Results

## Experimental Setup

We evaluated the proposed method using Llama 2-7B-hf, Llama 3-8B-Instruct, Llama 3.1-8B (Grattafiori et al. 2024), Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (Jiang et al. 2023), and Falcon-7B (Almazrouei et al. 2023) models. The datasets were selected based on three distinct evaluation schemes: ①Long Context Evaluation: We used the LongBench (Bai et al. 2024) benchmark to assess performance on long-context tasks. It encompasses multiple key long-text application scenarios. Due to the limited GPU memory, the maximum sequence length was set to 4096. ②Language Modeling: We measured the perplexity on the Wikitext-2 (Merity et al. 2016) dataset to evaluate its language modeling capabilities. ③Mathematical Reasoning: We employed the GSM8K (Cobbe et al. 2021) dataset to assess the model’s performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. We used the NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU (24GB) to evaluate the model’s inference efficiency and the KV cache’s compression rate.

Profiling Results We used 3-bit and 2-bit mixed quantization for Key, and 4bit and 2-bit mixed quantization for Value. When the KV is quantized to 3 bits or 4 bits, the RPC proportion is set to 20%; for 2-bit quantization, the RPC proportion is set to 10%. When the RPC proportion exceeds 20%, its contribution to accuracy improvement is marginal; thus, we selected 20% as the high-bit configuration for KVmix. The group size for quantization is 32. We selected 30 prompts from the Long- Bench for KV importance analysis. By the KVmix profiler, we can obtain the KV bit configurations and RPC proportions for each layer. When utilizing the KVmix profiler, randomly selecting 20 to 30 prompts is sufficient to yield reliable importance analysis results; additional prompts do not significantly alter the outcomes. For the models and experimental environment used in this work, this process requires only 10 to 15 minutes, highlighting the efficiency of the KVmix profiler. Users can flexibly customize the quantization configuration by adjusting the proportion of layers with different bit-widths in the KVmix profiler to meet varying accuracy or memory requirements. Fig. 5 illustrates the trends in accuracy, KV memory usage, and throughput as we varied the proportion of model layers quantized to 3 and 4 bits. When the proportion of model layers quantized to 3 and 4 bits is set to 20%, the optimal tradeoff among these three factors is achieved. Under this configuration, the average quantization bit-width for Key is 2.19 (exact value: 2.1875), and for Value is 2.38 (exact value: 2.375). The detailed configuration obtained using the KVmix profiler is shown in Fig. 6. Unless otherwise specified, the configuration is applied to the k-2.19v2.38 quantization in subsequent experiments.

Performance Evaluation Long Context We evaluated the performance of various quantization configurations across 8 distinct datasets from the LongBench benchmark, using the FP16 model as the baseline. The detailed experimental results are presented in the Table

1. The findings indicate that KVmix-k2.19v2.38 achieves an average accuracy loss (average values on 4 different models) of 1.67% compared to the FP16 baseline. In contrast, the average accuracy loss of KVmix-2bit reached 4.53% relative to the baseline. In addition, random selection of high-bit quantization layers (random-k2.19v2.38) leads to an average accuracy loss of 4.06%. These accuracy losses are significantly higher than KVmix-k2.19v2.38, demonstrating the advantage of KV importance-aware mixed quantization. The average accuracy of KVmix-k2.19v2.38w/oRPC decreases by 3.28% compared with KVmix-k2.19v2.38, proving the effectiveness of using RPC for improving model accuracy.

We compared KVmix against prior SOTA methods for KV Cache, specifically Key per-channel and Value per-token methods, i.e., KIVI (Liu et al. 2024c) and KVQuant (Hooper et al. 2024), since they are known to minimize KV quantization errors. Additionally, we evaluated KVmix against the latest SOTA method, QJL (Zandieh, Daliri, and Han 2025). Table 2 presents the accuracy results. The results show that KVmix-k2.19v2.38 surpasses the performance of KIVI- 2bit-r64 and QJL-3bit, reducing the average accuracy loss by 1.50% and 0.68%, respectively. While KVQuant-3bit- 1% achieves accuracy comparable to KVmix-k2.19v2.38, its memory compression ratio and inference efficiency fall short of those delivered by KVmix-k2.19v2.38 (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). By increasing the quantization bit-width, KVmix-k2.28v2.56 demonstrates a more significant advantage over KVQuant- 3bit-1% in accuracy, while maintaining a comparable memory compression ratio (4.8×) and superior inference acceleration (5.23×). This flexibility in balancing accuracy and quantization bit-width represents a critical strength of KVmix.

GSM8K and Wikitext-2 We evaluated the capabilities of the quantized model in language modeling and mathematical reasoning using the FP16 model as the baseline. Atom (Zhao et al. 2024) exhibits very poor performance in long contexts, and thus, we only compare it in this section. The evaluation was conducted using the lm_eval (Gao et al. 2024) framework, where the quantized model replaced the Hugging Face model. Specifically, we measured the accuracy on the GSM8K dataset and the perplexity on the Wikitext-2 dataset. The experimental results are detailed in Table 3. The results show that 2bit (k-T, v-T) suffers a catastrophic performance loss on GSM8K and Wikitext-2, and the model almost loses its reasoning ability. For 4bit (k-T, v-T), the performance loss of the model on GSM8K and Wikitext-2 also reached 9.17%

**Table 1.** Model accuracy of 4 LLMs on LongBench with different quantization configurations. KVmix-k2.19v2.38 uses the configurations of Fig. 6. KVmix-2bit uses the asymmetric 2-bit (Key per-channel and Value per-token) quantization for all model layers (RPC ratio is set to 10%). random-k2.19v2.38 randomly selects 20% of the model layers to perform asymmetric 3-bit and 4-bit quantization for Key and Value (RPC ratio is set to 20%), and the remaining layers are 2-bit quantization (RPC ratio is set to 10%). KVmix-k2.19v2.38w/oRPC is KVmix-k2.19v2.38 without RPC (RPC ratio is set to 0%).

and 5.28%, respectively. In contrast, on the Wikitext-2, the perplexity score of KVmix-k2.19v2.38 is almost comparable to the baseline, while on the more challenging GSM8K mathematical reasoning task, KVmix-k2.19v2.38 has an accuracy loss of 2.00%, which significantly outperforms the 2bit (k-T, v-T) and the 4bit (k-T, v-T). Moreover, on GSM8K, KVmixk2.19v2.38 shows a significant accuracy improvement compared to KVmix-2bit and random-k2.19v2.38, which do not leverage the KV importance analysis for more accurate quantization. Compared to Atom-4bit and other SOTA methods, KVmix-k2.19v2.38 also has an accuracy advantage. Notably, the Atom-4bit performs 4-bit quantization on both the model weights and activations, which results in greater accuracy loss. These results demonstrate the superior performance of KVmix-k2.19v2.38 in complex task reasoning.

Inference Efficiency and Memory Usage Evaluation We evaluated the inference throughput and memory usage of KVmix during inference. To ensure fairness, we applied identical input data across all evaluated methods. The number of input tokens is 688, the maximum number of new tokens is set to 1024, and the model is Llama 2-7B-hf. We compared KVmix against the KIVI-2bit-r64, KVQuant-3bit-1%, QJL- 3bit, and Atom-4bit. Memory usage results are illustrated in Fig. 7, with a batch size fixed at 4. The reported memory usage represents the peak memory usage during inference minus the memory occupied by the model before inference. To fully utilize the GPU memory, we incrementally increased the batch size to explore KVmix’s maximum throughput. The throughput results are shown in Fig. 8. The baseline (FP16), Aotm-4bit, and KIVI-2bit-r64 reach out of memory at batch sizes of 4, 18, and 28, respectively, while the KVmixk2.19v2.38 can reach a maximum batch size of 30 with an inference throughput of 1032 tokens per second.

The results reveal that KVmix-k2.19v2.38 achieves a 4.9× reduction in memory usage and up to a 5.3× increase in throughput compared to the baseline. This efficient memory compression stems from KVmix’s extremely low bit quantization and dynamic RPC strategy, which progressively reduces the full-precision KV as inference progresses. In contrast, KIVI employs a fixed full-precision residual strategy, unable to dynamically reduce the number of full-precision KVs.

Thus, KVmix saves more memory than KIVI-2bit despite using Key-2.19 and Value-2.38 bit quantization. Meanwhile, Atom quantizes both model weights and activations while utilizing tensor cores for optimized kernel, achieving a higher throughput at the same batch size but incurring greater model

accuracy degradation (Table 3). While KVQuant achieves significant memory compression, its inference efficiency is hampered by substantial preprocessing requirements. QJL implements “zero-overhead” quantization by eliminating the need to store extra constants like zero-points and scaling factors. This allows it to achieve a slightly better memory compression compared to KVmix, but its inference efficiency and accuracy are lower than those of KVmix.

## Conclusion

This paper proposes KVmix, a novel mixed quantization method tackling the KV Cache memory bottleneck in LLM inference. KVmix creatively integrates layer importance analysis based on KV weight gradients into KV quantization and integrates dynamic long-context optimization to cut memory usage while maintaining generation quality. It achieves significant memory and efficiency gains with minimal loss in accuracy, offering flexibility to adapt quantization strategies to diverse scenarios. Future work will explore integrating lightweight mechanisms for real-time KV bit adjustments into KVmix to enhance adaptability.
