## Abstract

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in various domains. However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for “When,” “Why Not,” and “What” types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.

## Introduction

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling multi-agent sequential decision-making across various domains such as autonomous driving (Dinneweth et al. 2022) and multi-robot warehousing (Krnjaic et al. 2022). Recent works have explored generating explanations for MARL policies to enhance system transparency, improve user understanding, and foster human-agent collaboration (Boggess, Kraus, and Feng 2022, 2023). However, these prior efforts are primarily limited to centralized MARL frameworks, where joint policies are learned and executed with full observability. Such methods cannot adequately address the uncertainty, nondeterminism, and limited observability inherent in decentralized MARL settings, which are common in real-world applications with communication or scalability constraints.

This work addresses this gap by introducing methods for generating policy summarizations and query-based explanations for decentralized MARL policies. Our approach is the first to summarize and explain agent coordination and task ordering under decentralized execution, enabling users to interpret multi-agent behavior even when individual agents act independently and only have local observations.

For example, consider a search and rescue mission where multiple cooperative robots follow a decentralized MARL policy. A human operator in the field receives decisionmaking support via an explainer that provides high-level policy summaries and answers user queries using real-time trajectory data. The summaries help the operator understand general robot behaviors—task completion, agent cooperation, task order—while the query-based explanations answer specific questions, such as: “When do [agents] complete [task]?”, “Why don’t [agents] complete [task] under [conditions]?”, or “What do the agents do after [task]?”. With this information, the operator can make informed decisions, such as prioritizing urgent tasks or allocating resources more effectively.

A key challenge in supporting such explanations is representing the uncertain, asynchronous execution of decentralized policies. Each agent’s policy governs only its local behavior, possibly unaware of others’ actions, making it difficult to infer global task order or cooperation from raw trajectories alone.

To tackle this, we develop a novel algorithm that constructs Hasse diagram-based summarizations from trajectories generated under decentralized execution. Each diagram is a directed acyclic graph where nodes represent tasks (annotated with the agents that completed them), and edges encode partial-order constraints over task completion times. The resulting diagrams compactly capture both coordination and uncertainty: branching edges represent nondeterminism in task order, while nodes annotated with multiple agents indicate cooperation on shared tasks.

Building on this, we develop query-based explanation methods for three types of user queries: “When?”, “Why not?”, and “What?”. Given a set of Hasse diagrams, we derive abstract states that encode key features such as task completions and agent involvement. To capture uncertainty, we introduce an uncertainty dictionary derived from partial comparability graphs that summarize unordered task dependencies across episodes. We then apply the Quine- McCluskey algorithm (Quine 1952) to extract minimal Boolean formulas, which are translated into natural language explanations using structured templates, with uncertain features explicitly expressed using “may” conditions.

We evaluate our method’s generalizability and computational efficiency across four benchmark MARL domains,

scaling to settings with up to 19 tasks and 9 agents. To demonstrate the algorithm-agnostic nature of our method, we apply it to two distinct MARL algorithms that both yield decentralized policies but differ in their training paradigms: centralized training versus decentralized training.

Finally, we assess the effectiveness of our summarizations and explanations via two user studies measuring objective task performance and subjective ratings. Results show that our approach significantly improves user questionanswering accuracy and boosts subjective ratings such as understanding and satisfaction.

Together, these contributions bridge the gap between opaque decentralized MARL policies and interpretable, human-centered explanations, enabling effective humanagent collaboration in multi-agent environments.

## Related Work

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. MARL algorithms are commonly categorized by their training and execution paradigms. Centralized training and centralized execution (CTCE) methods train a single policy using full observability of the environment and agent states (Albrecht, Christianos, and Sch¨afer 2023). Centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) methods, such as SEAC (Christianos, Sch¨afer, and Albrecht 2020), use global information during training but deploy policies that operate on local observations at execution time. Decentralized training and decentralized execution (DTDE) methods, including independent learning approaches (Papoudakis et al. 2021), train each agent’s policy independently, treating other agents as part of the environment. This work focuses on post-hoc summarization and explanation of both CTDE and DTDE policies in cooperative settings. Policy Summarization. Explainable RL (XRL) has received increasing attention, as surveyed in (Milani et al. 2023; Wells and Bednarz 2021), though most prior work targets single-agent settings. For instance, (Topin and Veloso 2019) introduces abstract policy graphs, which represent agent behavior as Markov chains over abstract states, and (McCalmon et al. 2022) improves their comprehensibility. (Amir and Amir 2018) visualizes agent behavior via representative trajectory videos. In the multi-agent domain, (Milani et al. 2022) uses intrinsically interpretable decision trees, while (Boggess, Kraus, and Feng 2022) abstracts centralized MARL policies into macro-actions over joint state-action trajectories to identify common agent behaviors. However, all of these methods assume a single input policy, whether from a single agent or a centralized multi-agent controller. In contrast, we consider decentralized settings where each agent has its own policy and actions may require interagent coordination. We develop a scalable method to summarize such decentralized executions using compact, structured representations. Query-Based Explanations. Post-hoc explanations in single-agent RL often rely on abstract state representations (Hayes and Shah 2017; Sreedharan et al. 2022), saliency maps (Atrey, Clary, and Jensen 2019), causal models (Madumal et al. 2020), or reward decompositions (Juoza- paitis et al. 2019). Several works have extended these ideas to multi-agent systems, but typically assume centralized control or non-cooperative agents. For example, (Boggess, Kraus, and Feng 2022) applies abstract policy graphs to centralized MARL, (Heuillet, Couthouis, and D´ıaz-Rodr´ıguez 2022; Mahjoub et al. 2024; Chen et al. 2025) compute agent contributions to joint policies, and (Kottinger, Almagor, and Lahijanian 2021) visualizes action assignments in joint plans. (Mualla et al. 2022) proposes a framework for generating parsimonious explanations for teams of BDI agents. However, these methods do not support inter-agent cooperation under decentralized policies and often aggregate agent behavior in a naive or disjointed manner.

To our knowledge, this is the first work to generate both policy summarizations and query-based explanations for decentralized MARL policies.

## 3 Policy Summarization

Decentralized MARL Policies. Consider N agents, each with a decentralized MARL policy πi: si →∆(ai) mapping local state si to a distribution over actions ai. Agents act asynchronously due to decentralized execution without a global clock. Joint tasks are assumed to be completed simultaneously, with each agent observing only its own contribution and reward. Executing these policies yields trajectories {ωi}N i=1, where ωi = si

0, ai 0, ri 0, si 1, · · · records transitions observed by agent i. A task sequence trace(ωi) = τ i

1, τ i 2, · · · can be extracted from each trajectory ωi, where a completed task τ is inferred from reward signals and state transitions. Problem Statement. Given decentralized MARL policies and their execution trajectories, how can we generate a compact, interpretable summary that captures both individual and joint agent behaviors? We seek a representation that ensures correctness, meaning each agent’s behavior in the summary aligns with its actual task sequence, and completeness, meaning each agent’s full task sequence is captured in at least one path in the summary. Hasse Diagram Summarization. We propose to summarize decentralized agent behavior using a Hasse diagram D = (V, E), a directed acyclic graph that represents a partial order over task completions (Sarkar 2017). Each vertex denotes a set of tasks completed simultaneously and the agents that perform them. Edges encode precedence: v ≺v′ indicates that tasks in v must precede those in v′. A path ρ = v0 → v1 →· · · through D defines a possible task ordering. The projection of ρ onto agent i, denoted ρi, retains only tasks performed by agent i. We say ρi conforms to the agent’s trajectory trace(ωi) if ρi ⊑trace(ωi)—i.e., the task order is preserved.

Formally, the diagram D is correct if, for all paths ρ and agents i, either ρi = ∅or ρi ⊑trace(ωi). It is complete if, for every agent i, there exists a path ρ such that ρi = trace(ωi).

We present Algorithm 1, which constructs a correct and complete Hasse diagram D from a single episode of decentralized execution trajectories {ωi}N i=1, agnostic to how the policies are trained (e.g., CTDE, DTDE). The algorithm iterates through task sequences, creates nodes for new tasks,

identifies agents for shared tasks, and inserts edges to maintain local task order. Finally, a transitive reduction is applied to eliminate redundant edges.

**Figure 1.** shows an example of applying Algorithm 1, illustrating the incremental construction of a Hasse diagram summarizing agents’ behavior. Complexity and Guarantee. The worst-case time complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(N·|T|2+|T|4), where N is the number of agents and |T| is the number of tasks. The O(N ·|T|2) term covers task-wise updates across N trajectories, and the O(|T|4) term arises from transitive reduction over a graph with up to |T|2 edges.

Theorem 1. Given a set of agent trajectories {ωi}N i=1 produced by executing decentralized MARL policies {πi}N i=1 in a single episode, the Hasse diagram D = (V, E) constructed by Algorithm 1 is both a correct and complete policy summarization. (Proof provided in the appendix of (Boggess, Kraus, and Feng 2025).)

Practical Considerations. In large environments, users are often interested in only a subset of agents or tasks (e.g., nearby robots in a search and rescue scenario). Our method supports selective summarization by restricting input to relevant agent trajectories and applying task filters during sequence extraction.

Because decentralized execution is stochastic, different episodes may yield different Hasse diagrams. To summarize observed behaviors, we rely on actual trajectories; to capture potential future behaviors, we can simulate multiple episodes and report a representative diagram, such as the most frequent one.

## 4 Query-Based Explanations While

Hasse diagrams summarize global behavior, they do not explain local decisions—such as when agents choose to perform a task, why they fail to do so under certain conditions, or what they do next. To address this gap, we develop methods that generate language-based explanations in response to user queries. Our approach builds on prior work in query-based explanations for single-agent (Hayes and Shah 2017) and centralized multi-agent settings (Boggess, Kraus, and Feng 2022), but introduces new techniques to address the uncertainty and partial observability inherent in decentralized execution.

4.1 Answering “When” Queries We consider queries of the form: “When do agents Gq perform task τq?”, aiming to identify the necessary conditions under which τq is completed by agent group Gq across multiple simulated executions. Algorithm 2 outlines our method for generating language-based explanations for such queries.

We begin by extracting a subset of features Fq ⊆F that are relevant to the query task, using domain knowledge. For example, for the query “When do agents 2 and 4 do task C?”,

## Algorithm

2 “When” Query-Based Explanation Input: Agent group Gq, query task τq, Hasse diagrams {Dj}, and feature set F Output: Language-based explanation X

1: Extract relevant features Fq ⊆F for τq 2: Initialize uncertainty dictionary U ←∅ 3: for each diagram Dj do 4: if τq completed by Gq in Dj then 5: Let vτ be the node where τq is completed 6: Compute partial comparability graph from vτ 7: for each node v not reachable to/from vτ do 8: Add features associated with v to U[Dj] 9: Label nodes as targets (containing τq by Gq) or non-targets 10: Encode nodes as boolean vectors over Fq using U 11: Apply Quine-McCluskey to distinguish targets/non-targets 12: Translate resulting formula into explanation X 13: return X relevant features may include boolean predicates indicating whether agents 2 or 4 complete task C, as well as whether potentially prerequisite tasks (e.g., task A, B, etc.) have been completed.

Given a set of Hasse diagrams {Dj} summarizing multiple episodes of decentralized policy execution, we check, for each diagram Dj, whether the query task τq is completed by the queried agent group Gq. If so, we identify the corresponding node vτ and construct a partial comparability graph (Kelly 1985) centered at vτ, which includes only nodes with a known ordering relative to vτ (i.e., those reachable via the Hasse diagram’s edges in either direction).

To handle partial observability and structural ambiguity in decentralized execution, we introduce an uncertainty dictionary U. Any node that is not reachable to or from vτ is considered unordered with respect to the query task. Features associated with such nodes are marked as uncertain and stored in U[Dj]. For example, if task B appears in a node unconnected to the node where agents 2 and 4 complete task C, we cannot determine whether task B occurred before or after task C. As a result, the feature “task B completed” is added to U[Dj] and treated as a possible—but not confirmed—precondition for task C.

We then label nodes as targets if they satisfy the query (i.e., they contain τq completed by Gq), and as non-targets otherwise. Each node is encoded as a boolean vector over the relevant feature set Fq, where each bit indicates whether the corresponding feature is satisfied along a path to that node. To avoid underestimating dependencies, features marked as uncertain in U are conservatively treated as true in the boolean encoding.

To identify distinguishing conditions, we apply Quine- McCluskey (Quine 1952) to derive a minimal boolean formula that separates targets from non-targets. Finally, we translate the resulting formula into a language explanation using a structured language template, mapping certain features to “must” and uncertain ones to “may”.

An example of a generated explanation is: “For agents 2 and 4 to complete task C, agent 2 must complete task C, agent 4 must complete task C, and task A must be completed. Additionally, task B may need to be completed.”

## Algorithm

3 “What” Query-Based Explanation Input: Query task τq, Hasse diagrams {Dj} Output: Language-based explanation X

1: Initialize sets T c ←∅, T u ←∅ 2: for each diagram Dj do 3: for each node v ∈Dj do 4: if v contains τq completed by any agent group then 5: Add tasks from all immediate children of v to T c

6: Compute partial comparability graph from v 7: for each node v′ not reachable to/from v do 8: Add tasks from v′ to T u

9: Translate T c and T u into explanation X 10: return X

While prior methods (Hayes and Shah 2017; Boggess, Kraus, and Feng 2022) also use Quine-McCluskey minimization followed by language translation, they do not account for the uncertainty introduced by decentralized execution. In contrast, Algorithm 2 incorporates partial comparability graphs and an uncertainty dictionary to capture unordered task dependencies, enabling “may” conditions in the resulting explanations. Complexity. The dominant cost of Algorithm 2 is Quine-McCluskey minimization with worst-case complexity O(3|Fq|/ ln |Fq|). Other steps scale linearly with the number of Hasse diagrams and nodes. The method is tractable in practice for moderate feature sizes.

4.2 Answering “Why Not” Queries To answer queries of the form: “Why don’t agents Gq do task τq under conditions Φq?”, we adapt the procedure used for “When” queries. Instead of identifying preconditions for successful completions, the goal is to isolate the minimal set of missing conditions that prevent τq from occurring under the given scenario.

The key difference lies in how we define the target and non-target sets: the user-provided condition Φq is encoded as the target (i.e., a case where the task did not occur), while nodes from Hasse diagrams where τq is successfully completed by Gq serve as non-targets. As in the “When” query, we construct partial comparability graphs to identify ordering uncertainty and maintain an uncertainty dictionary to track ambiguous dependencies. These are incorporated into the boolean encoding, allowing us to apply Quine- McCluskey minimization to identify which missing features distinguish the query condition from successful executions. The full algorithm pseudocode is provided in the appendix of (Boggess, Kraus, and Feng 2025) and shares the same complexity as Algorithm 2.

For instance, for the query “Why don’t agents 2 and 4 complete task C when only task A is completed?”, the resulting explanation could be: “Task B may need to be completed for agents 2 and 4 to complete task C.”

4.3 Answering “What” Queries To answer queries of the form: “What do the agents do after task τq?”, we analyze the successors of τq across multiple Hasse diagrams. Our goal is to identify which tasks occur

17360

<!-- Page 5 -->

after τq, distinguishing between those that are certainly ordered afterward and those that may follow, but whose ordering is ambiguous due to decentralized execution.

Given a set of Hasse diagrams {Dj} generated from simulated episodes, we first locate all nodes where τq is completed. For each such node, we add the tasks from its immediate children, representing actions that are explicitly ordered after τq, to a set of certain successors T c.

To identify uncertain successors T u, we construct a partial comparability graph rooted at each node where τq is completed. We then collect tasks from nodes that are not ordered with respect to it. These tasks are added to a set T u as possible, but not guaranteed, successors of τq.

We generate an explanation using a language template that reports both the certain and uncertain successor sets. For example, for the query “What do agents do after task C is completed?”, the explanation could be: “After task C is completed, tasks D and E are completed. Additionally, task B may be completed.” Complexity. The worst-case time complexity of Algorithm 3 is O(|{Dj}| · |V|2(|V| + |E|)), where |{Dj}| is the number of Hasse diagrams, and |V| and |E| are the number of nodes and edges in each diagram, respectively.

Computational Experiments

MARL Domains. We evaluate our approaches on four benchmark domains: (1) Search and Rescue (SR) (Boggess, Kraus, and Feng 2022), where agents rescue victims and fight fires; (2) Level-Based Foraging (LBF) (Papoudakis et al. 2021), where agents collect food; (3) Multi-Robot Warehouse (RW) (Papoudakis et al. 2021), where agents pick up and deliver items; and (4) Pressure Plate (PP) (McInroe and Christianos 2022), where agents open doors to enable others’ navigation. All domains are gridworld-based. Agents observe nearby grid cells only: up to four per direction in PP and one per direction in other domains, reflecting the partial observability of decentralized execution. Experimental Setup. We train policies using two MARL algorithms: Shared Experience Actor-Critic (SEAC) (Christianos, Sch¨afer, and Albrecht 2020) for CTDE, and Independent Advantage Actor-Critic (IA2C) (Papoudakis et al. 2021) for DTDE. Each model is trained until convergence or for up to 400 million steps. All experiments are conducted on a machine with a 2.1 GHz Intel CPU, 132 GB RAM, and Ubuntu 22.04.

## 5.1 Evaluation on Policy Summarization

Summarization Baseline. Since no existing methods summarize decentralized MARL policies, we adapt the singleagent approach from (McCalmon et al. 2022) as a baseline. For each agent, we construct an abstract policy graph that summarizes task sequences observed over 100 episodes, using the same abstract features as our HDS method for fair comparison. The resulting agent-specific graphs are displayed side-by-side and annotated with task sequence probabilities. Results. Table 1 compares CTDE policy summarization sizes (number of nodes and edges) produced by our HDS

Domain HDS Baseline

SR (9,7) 8 7.88 534 525 LBF (9,9) 10 10.83 723 714 RW (4,19) 20 19 1,274 1,270 PP (7,6) 7 6 265 258

method and the baseline for the largest configuration in each domain (i.e., with the most agents and tasks). HDS generates one Hasse diagram per episode, each representing a complete summary of all agents’ behavior in that episode; we report average size over 100 episodes. In contrast, the baseline displays all observed task sequences across episodes for all agents, resulting in large visualizations with hundreds of nodes and edges, which are significantly harder to interpret than the compact Hasse diagrams. Similar results hold for DTDE policies trained with IA2C.

Both HDS and the baseline are computationally efficient, each processing 100 episodes and generating summarizations in under one second across all domains.

Additionally, while HDS often produces unique Hasse diagrams across episodes, they typically fall into a small number of structural types based on edge counts. For example, SR(9,7) yields 100 unique diagrams but only 6 distinct edge counts.

## 5.2 Evaluation on Query-Based Explanations

Explanation Baseline. Since no existing methods generate query-based explanations for decentralized MARL, we adapt the single-agent explanation approach from (Hayes and Shah 2017) by applying it independently to each agent’s abstract policy graph (described in Section 5.1). The resulting per-agent explanations are then merged using simple union-based aggregation as a baseline. Results. Table 2 compares explanation sizes for “When” queries on CTDE policies, measured by the number of certain (|Fc|) and uncertain (|Fu|) features extracted by our method and the baseline. These features are derived from boolean formulas obtained through Quine-McCluskey minimization. In all cases, both methods generate explanations

17361

<!-- Page 6 -->

in under one second.

The baseline includes only certain features, as it does not capture task ordering uncertainty. It also produces significantly larger explanations due to the size of its aggregated policy graphs and union-based merging of per-agent results. In contrast, our HD-When method yields more compact and informative explanations, balancing certain and uncertain features. In RW(4,19), all features are marked uncertain due to highly asynchronous execution. Similar trends are observed for DTDE policies and for other query types (see the appendix of (Boggess, Kraus, and Feng 2025)).

User Studies

We conducted two user studies (with IRB approval) to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed policy summarizations and query-based explanations.

For both studies, we recruited participants via university mailing lists to answer surveys via Qualtrics. Eligible participants were fluent English speakers over 18 years old and were incentivized with bonus payments for correctly answering questions based on the provided summarizations or explanations. The summarization study included 20 participants (10 males, 9 females, 1 other), with an average age of 22.55 years (SD = 2.89). The explanation study included 21 participants (14 males, 6 females, 1 other), with an average age of 24 years (SD = 3.95).

We describe the study design and results for each study in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, respectively.

## 6.1 Summarization Study

Independent Variables. The independent variable in this study was the summarization generation approach: our HDS method or the baseline described in Section 5.1. The baseline displays side-by-side abstract policy graphs for each agent, with each agent’s most likely task sequence highlighted. To aid interpretation, the HDS interface presents a table of agent-task assignments and a list of task-ordering rules converted from each Hasse diagram. It shows the top three most frequent plans from 100 episodes, annotated with empirical likelihoods, and highlights the most likely one in red. Procedures. The study followed a within-subject design where each participant completed two trials, one per summarization method (HDS and baseline). Each trial consisted of two summarizations, and each summarization was followed by three questions (12 questions total). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups to counterbalance ordering effects (HDS first or baseline first). All questions were randomized. Prior to each trial, participants received a brief tutorial and passed attention-check questions to ensure engagement. Bonus incentives and timing were used to promote data quality. Dependent Measures. We assessed user performance based on the number of correctly answered questions in three categories: assignment (e.g., “Can [robot(s)] complete [task]?”), likelihood (e.g., “What are the most likely robot(s) to complete [task]?”), and order (e.g., “Must [task 1] always

**Figure 2.** Mean and standard deviation of participant ratings on policy summarizations (* indicates statistically significant difference).

be completed before [task 2]?”). Response time was also recorded for each question.

At the end of each trial, participants rated the summarization quality on a 5-point Likert scale across seven metrics (Hoffman et al. 2018): understanding, satisfaction, detail, completeness, actionability, reliability, and trustworthiness. Participants were informed of their accuracy before providing ratings. Hypotheses. We hypothesized that, compared to baseline summarizations, HDS would (H1) improve user questionanswering performance and (H2) receive higher ratings on summarization quality metrics. Results. We found that users answered significantly more questions correctly using HDS (M=4.25 out of 6, SD=0.83) than with the baseline (M=3.1 out of 6, SD=1.04). A paired t-test confirms this difference is statistically significant (t(19)=4.2, p ≤0.01, d=0.96). The data supports H1.

Regarding user-perceived summarization quality, HDS was rated slightly higher in completeness (Wilcoxon signedrank, W=16.0, Z=-2.07, p ≤0.04, r=-0.33), but not significantly different in other dimensions (see Figure 2). The data partially supports H2. Discussion. These results suggest that HDS improves objective user performance in answering questions that require understanding task coordination across agents. Because the baseline does not explicitly model inter-agent cooperation, users must compare across graphs to infer coordination, which can be cognitively demanding. Moreover, the baseline may mislead by showing each agent’s most likely task sequence independently, which may not reflect the most likely joint behavior in coordination.

Subjective ratings show limited preference for HDS, possibly due to user familiarity with the baseline’s flowchartstyle layout despite its reduced clarity on coordination.

Finally, we note that users’ response times remained comparable between methods. In some cases, HDS enabled faster responses (e.g., for likelihood queries).

explanation generation method: our proposed approach versus the baseline described in Section 5.2. Example interfaces for all three query types (“When,” “Why Not,” and “What”) are shown in the appendix of (Boggess, Kraus, and Feng 2025). For “When” queries, users viewed a map of a search-andrescue scenario (with four agents and four tasks) and an accompanying explanation. Our method outputs both required (certain) and possible (uncertain) conditions, while the baseline includes only certain ones.

For “Why Not” queries, users were shown two maps: the first with a failed task and an explanation of the violated conditions, and the second used to test whether the explanation helped predict behavior.

For “What” queries, users received an explanation about what tasks could occur next. Our method distinguishes certain and uncertain tasks; the baseline lists only certain ones. Procedures. The study followed a within-subject design, where each participant completed two trials—one using our method, and one using the baseline. Each trial included two questions per query type (“When,” “Why Not,” and “What”), totaling 12 questions. Method order was counterbalanced across participants to mitigate ordering effects. The study included a demonstration, attention-check questions, bonus incentives, and timing to ensure data quality. Dependent Measures. User performance was measured by the number of correctly answered prediction questions, reported separately for each query type. Response time per question was also recorded. After each trial, participants rated explanation quality on a 5-point Likert scale (Hoffman et al. 2018) using the same seven metrics described in Section 6.1. Hypotheses. We hypothesized that, compared to the baseline, our generated explanations would (H3) improve user question-answering performance and (H4) receive higher ratings on explanation quality metrics. Results. As shown in Figure 3, users answered significantly more questions correctly using our HDE explanations compared to the baseline across all three query types. Paired t-tests (α = 0.05) confirm the improvement for when (t(20)=9.65, p ≤0.01, d=2.16), why not (t(20)=13.23, p ≤ 0.01, d=2.96), and what (t(20)=12.05, p ≤0.01, d=2.69). The data supports H3.

**Figure 4.** Mean and standard deviation of participant ratings on query-based explanations (* indicates statistically significant difference).

**Figure 4.** shows participant ratings on explanation quality. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (α = 0.05) indicate significantly higher ratings for HDE across all seven metrics: understanding (W=3.5, Z=-3.02, p ≤0.01, r=-0.47), satisfaction (W=5.0, Z=-3.01, p ≤0.01, r=-0.46), detail (W=4.5, Z=-3.02, p ≤0.01, r=-0.47), completeness (W=0.0, Z=-3.21, p ≤0.01, r=-0.49), actionability (W=4.0, Z=-2.53, p ≤0.02, r=-0.39), reliability (W=3.0, Z=-2.78, p ≤0.01, r=-0.43), and trust (W=0.0, Z=-2.68, p ≤0.01, r=0.41). The data supports H4. Discussion. The improvement in user performance is likely due to our explanation method’s ability to present both certain and uncertain features, enabling users to more accurately predict if and what tasks will occur. In contrast, the baseline captures only agent-specific behavior and lacks inter-agent context. It may omit shared task dependencies or include irrelevant conditions observed by individual agents, requiring users to reconcile fragmented information—reducing its effectiveness in decentralized settings.

Participants also gave higher subjective ratings to our explanations across all goodness metrics, suggesting they valued access to decentralized task dependencies and uncertainty, even if the explanations were more complex. Notably, the inclusion of uncertain features did not increase response time, indicating that users could efficiently interpret the richer information.

## Conclusion

We presented novel approaches for summarizing and explaining decentralized MARL policies. Computational experiments across four MARL domains and two learning algorithms show that our method is scalable and efficient, generating compact summarizations and meaningful explanations in large environments. User studies further demonstrate that our approach improves user performance and perceived explanation quality, without increasing response time. Future work includes integrating these explanations into interactive human-agent systems, supporting more expressive user queries, and leveraging large language models to enhance explanation clarity and usability.
